        <h1>List of helicopter prison escapes</h1>
        <h4>
            There have been multiple prison escapes where an inmate escapes by means of a helicopter. One of the earliest instances was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971, from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.[3][4] Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only escaped the prison but eventually got out of Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, The 10-Second Jailbreak.[5]
        </h4>
        <h6>
            To thwart attempts of this nature, many prisons have taken precautions such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards.[9]

This list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.
